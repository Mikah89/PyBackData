PyBackData
==========

PyBackData is a python util tool that allows users to backup their data on Dropbox. Soon some more services will
be added to this tool (waiting on your contribution!!).

**Why?**

Simply put, in my case I needed something that simply pushed the files I wanted to dropbox but not the way back.
Well for that we have the dropbox client. This tool is supposed to mimic a "copy/paste" of the file with no sync back.

**What you need to do?**

Check out the repo and simply run pybackdata.py with the specific service. Do not forget to install the needed dependencies to run each
service. These instructions should be added on the services README. Also if a configuration file exists each necessary 
key should be explained.

**Contributions**

More online services or improvement to the existing ones is always welcome!
